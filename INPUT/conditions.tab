Through laser microdissection coupled to RNA sequencing, we provide precise transcriptomic analysis of the inflorescence meristem, floral meristem and of the flower at the beginning of organ differentiation. Transcript abundance quantification and differential expression (DE) analyses were performed using the Bowtie/Tophat/Cufflinks pipeline (BTC) (Trapnell et al., 2012) with the RefSeq Arabidopsis annotation. The BTC pipeline identified 46 genes as differentially expressed between IM and FM, 171 genes differentially expressed between FM and ST3 and 178 genes differentially expressed between IM and ST3. The obtained data turned out to be solid since they are highly consistent with established knowledge but they also allowed the identification of new high profile candidate genes as well as new insights into potential regulatory networks underlying the formation of these reproductive structures. We provide a web interface for easy interrogation of these unique datasets.

In plants, Cu plays key roles in electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria, as well as in cell wall metabolism, ethylene perception, molybdenum cofactor synthesis and oxidative stress protection. Because of its physiological importance, suboptimal concentrations of Cu trigger a re-organization of metabolism to economize on Cu, and pronounced Cu deficiency causes severe growth reduction and defects in male fertility. However, when present in excess, Cu can be highly toxic. Therefore, Cu uptake, utilization and cellular concentrations are strictly regulated. A number of components of the Cu-homeostatic network of Arabidopsis have already been identified. However, the mechanisms that control responses of plant gene expression to Cu-deficiency are only partly understood. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the transcription factor Crr1 is required for activating and/or repressing the expression of a number of genes in response to Cu deficiency. This protein contains a plant-specific DNA-binding domain (SBP domain), ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region with similarity to a Drosophila metallothionein (MT). In Arabidopsis, there is a family of 16 proteins with SBP domains named SPL family (SBP-like) of which a subset of proteins have been implicated in flowering time control and floral development. Among all of them, AtSPL7 is the most similar to Crr1 (27 % identity), and AtSPL1 (25 % identity), AtSPL12 (24 % identity) and AtSPL14 (23 % identity) share a common protein architecture. The goal of this work was to obtain a complete account of the response of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome to Cu deficiency, as well as  to determine the role of AtSPL7 in the transcriptional response to Cu deficiency. For this purpose, three independent experiments were carried out including Col-0 wild-type and spl7-2 mutant plants grown in Cu-sufficient and Cu-deficient hydroponic media, respectively. Root and shoot transcriptomes were established by RNA-Seq for quantitative comparisons. Overall design: Sampling of root and shoot tissues of wild-type (WT, Col-0) and spl7-2 mutant plants (the mutant is knock-down for the transcription factor SPL7, which plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of the copper deficiency responses) cultivated hydroponically in a modified Hoagland's solution under Cu-sufficient (control) and Cu-deficient conditions.

In plants, Cu plays key roles in electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria, as well as in cell wall metabolism, ethylene perception, molybdenum cofactor synthesis and oxidative stress protection. Because of its physiological importance, suboptimal concentrations of Cu trigger a re-organization of metabolism to economize on Cu, and pronounced Cu deficiency causes severe growth reduction and defects in male fertility. However, when present in excess, Cu can be highly toxic. Therefore, Cu uptake, utilization and cellular concentrations are strictly regulated. A number of components of the Cu-homeostatic network of Arabidopsis have already been identified. However, the mechanisms that control responses of plant gene expression to Cu-deficiency are only partly understood. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the transcription factor Crr1 is required for activating and/or repressing the expression of a number of genes in response to Cu deficiency. This protein contains a plant-specific DNA-binding domain (SBP domain), ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region with similarity to a Drosophila metallothionein (MT). In Arabidopsis, there is a family of 16 proteins with SBP domains named SPL family (SBP-like) of which a subset of proteins have been implicated in flowering time control and floral development. Among all of them, AtSPL7 is the most similar to Crr1 (27 % identity), and AtSPL1 (25 % identity), AtSPL12 (24 % identity) and AtSPL14 (23 % identity) share a common protein architecture. The goal of this work was to obtain a complete account of the response of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome to Cu deficiency, as well as  to determine the role of AtSPL7 in the transcriptional response to Cu deficiency. For this purpose, three independent experiments were carried out including Col-0 wild-type and spl7-2 mutant plants grown in Cu-sufficient and Cu-deficient hydroponic media, respectively.

GA promotion of cell elongation required BR signaling, whereas BR or active BZR1 can suppresssed the GA-deficient dwarf phenotype. DELLAs directly interacted with BZR1 and inhibited BZR1-DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide analysis defined a BZR1-dependent GA-regulated transcriptome, which is enriched with light-regulated genes and genes involved in cell wall synthesis and photosynthesis/chloroplast. GA promotion of hypocotyl elongation requires both BZR1 and the phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs), as well as their common downstream targets PREs.

Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 plants were grown in hydroponic nitrate-free medium with 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as the only N-source for two weeks and were treated with 5 mM KNO3, or 5 mM KCl as control, for 2 hours. Total RNA from two independent sets of plants (biological replicates) was extracted from roots, and poly-A+ enriched and sRNA fractions were used to construct libraries for Illumina sequencing.

Adaptive changes in plant morphology and physiology triggered by changes in nitrate availability are partly explained by these changes in gene expression. Despite several genome-wide efforts to identify nitrate-regulated genes, no comprehensive study of the Arabidopsis root transcriptome under contrasting nitrate conditions has been carried out. In this work, we employed the Illumina high throughput sequencing technology to perform an integrated analysis of the poly-A+ enriched and the small RNA fractions of the Arabidopsis thaliana root transcriptome in response to nitrate treatments.

Plants have evolved strong innate immunity mechanisms, but successful pathogens evade or suppress plant immunity via effectors delivered into the plant cell. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) causes downy mildew on Arabidopsis thaliana, and a genome sequence is available for isolate Emoy2. Here, we exploit the availability of genome sequences for Hpa and Arabidopsis to measure gene-expression changes in both Hpa and Arabidopsis simultaneously during infection. Using a high-throughput cDNA tag sequencing method, we reveal expression patterns of Hpa predicted effectors and Arabidopsis genes in compatible and incompatible interactions, and promoter elements associated with Hpa genes expressed during infection. By resequencing Hpa isolate Waco9, we found it evades Arabidopsis resistance gene RPP1 through deletion of the cognate recognized effector ATR1. Arabidopsis salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes including PR1 were activated not only at early time points in the incompatible interaction but also at late time points in the compatible interaction. By histochemical analysis, we found that Hpa suppresses SA-inducible PR1 expression, specifically in the haustoriated cells into which host-translocated effectors are delivered, but not in non-haustoriated adjacent cells. Finally, we found a highly-expressed Hpa effector candidate that suppresses responsiveness to SA. As this approach can be easily applied to host-pathogen interactions for which both host and pathogen genome sequences are available, this work opens the door towards transcriptome studies in infection biology that should help unravel pathogen infection strategies and the mechanisms by which host defense responses are overcome. Overall design: Three weeks old Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants were inoculated with either the avirulent isolate Emoy2 (incompatible interaction) or the virulent isolate Waco9 (compatible interaction) of Hpa, and infected plants were harvested at 1, 3 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) for total RNA extraction. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol. Each biological replicate set of samples were sequenced as one batch (biorep1, biorep2 and biorep3 in filenames) and each batch was sequenced in 4 individual Illumina flowcell lanes (lane1 to lane4 in filenames). Four sequecing lanes of each three biological repliates resulted in 12 sequencing libraries. Emoy2 1, 3 and 5 dpi samples and Waco9 1 dpi samples were made two different codes (lib1 and lib2 in filenames) to generate higher depth of sequencing data.

Each biological replicate set of samples were sequenced as one batch (biorep1, biorep2 and biorep3 in filenames) and each batch was sequenced in 4 individual Illumina flowcell lanes (lane1 to lane4 in filenames). Four sequecing lanes of each three biological repliates resulted in 12 sequencing libraries. Emoy2 1, 3 and 5 dpi samples and Waco9 1 dpi samples were made two different codes (lib1 and lib2 in filenames) to generate higher depth of sequencing data.

Plants have evolved strong innate immunity mechanisms, but successful pathogens evade or suppress plant immunity via effectors delivered into the plant cell. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) causes downy mildew on Arabidopsis thaliana, and a genome sequence is available for isolate Emoy2. Here, we exploit the availability of genome sequences for Hpa and Arabidopsis to measure gene-expression changes in both Hpa and Arabidopsis simultaneously during infection. Using a high-throughput cDNA tag sequencing method, we reveal expression patterns of Hpa predicted effectors and Arabidopsis genes in compatible and incompatible interactions, and promoter elements associated with Hpa genes expressed during infection. By resequencing Hpa isolate Waco9, we found it evades Arabidopsis resistance gene RPP1 through deletion of the cognate recognized effector ATR1. Arabidopsis salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes including PR1 were activated not only at early time points in the incompatible interaction but also at late time points in the compatible interaction. By histochemical analysis, we found that Hpa suppresses SA-inducible PR1 expression, specifically in the haustoriated cells into which host-translocated effectors are delivered, but not in non-haustoriated adjacent cells. Finally, we found a highly-expressed Hpa effector candidate that suppresses responsiveness to SA.

The formation of the syncytium is orchestrated by the nematode in part by modulation of phytohormone responses, including cytokinin. In response to infection by the nematode H. schachtii, cytokinin signaling is transiently induced at the site of infection and in the developing syncytium. Arabidopsis lines with reduced cytokinin sensitivity show reduced susceptibility to nematode infection, indicating that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal nematode development. Furthermore, lines with increased cytokinin sensitivity also exhibit reduced nematode susceptibility. To ascertain why cytokinin hypersensitivity reduces nematode parasitism, we examined the transcriptomes in wild-type and a cytokinin-hypersensitive type-A arr Arabidopsis mutant in response to H. schachtii infection. Genes involved in the response to biotic stress and defense response were elevated in the type-A arr mutant in the absence of nematodes and were hyper-induced following H. schachtii infection, which suggests that the Arabidopsis type-A arr mutants impede nematode development because they are primed to respond to pathogen infection. These results suggest that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal H. schachtii parasitism of Arabidopsis, but that elevated cytokinin signaling triggers a heightened immune response to nematode infection. Overall design: Wild-type Col-0 and type-A arr3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15 octuple mutant Arabidopsis thaliana roots were infected with Heterodera schachti nematodes and whole root tissue was collected at 4 days post infection (dpi) and 10 dpi, along with the corresponding control roots that were not infected with nematodes.

The formation of the syncytium is orchestrated by the nematode in part by modulation of phytohormone responses, including cytokinin. In response to infection by the nematode H. schachtii, cytokinin signaling is transiently induced at the site of infection and in the developing syncytium. Arabidopsis lines with reduced cytokinin sensitivity show reduced susceptibility to nematode infection, indicating that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal nematode development. Furthermore, lines with increased cytokinin sensitivity also exhibit reduced nematode susceptibility. To ascertain why cytokinin hypersensitivity reduces nematode parasitism, we examined the transcriptomes in wild-type and a cytokinin-hypersensitive type-A arr Arabidopsis mutant in response to H. schachtii infection. Genes involved in the response to biotic stress and defense response were elevated in the type-A arr mutant in the absence of nematodes and were hyper-induced following H. schachtii infection, which suggests that the Arabidopsis type-A arr mutants impede nematode development because they are primed to respond to pathogen infection. These results suggest that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal H. schachtii parasitism of Arabidopsis, but that elevated cytokinin signaling triggers a heightened immune response to nematode infection. Overall design: Wild-type Col-0 and type-A arr3,4,5,6,7,8,9,15 octuple mutant Arabidopsis thaliana roots were infected with Heterodera schachti nematodes and whole root tissue was collected at 4 days post infection (dpi) and 10 dpi, along with the corresponding control roots that were not infected with nematodes.
